# Automation Project

### Description

The **Automation Project** contains a collection of automation scripts designed to automate interactions with different websites and platforms using **Java** and **Selenium WebDriver**. This project demonstrates the application of browser automation to perform various tasks such as logging in, browsing, data entry, searching, and form submissions across several popular websites.

Each class file automates specific tasks on platforms such as **AirAsia**, **AirIndia**, **Instagram**, **Burger King**, **ICICI Bank**, **Myntra**, **Swiggy**, **Zomato**, **eBay**, **Google**, **OrangeHRM**, and more. These scripts can serve both as functional testing examples and real-world automation use cases like online shopping, banking, and food delivery.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/automation-project.git
```

### Prerequisites

Before you can run the scripts, make sure you have the following installed:

1. **JDK 8** or above.
2. **Selenium WebDriver** set up in your project.
3. **ChromeDriver / FirefoxDriver** for automating browser interactions.
4. **Maven / Gradle** (optional) for managing dependencies and project setup.

## üèÉ Running the Automation Scripts

To run a specific automation script, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
2. Compile and run the Java file:

For example, to run the **AirAsia** flight booking automation:

```bash
javac AirAsia.java
java AirAsia
```

This will execute the script and perform the automation steps on the AirAsia website.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Running Multiple Scripts in Parallel

You can run automation scripts in parallel using the `ParallelBrowser.java` class. This allows you to test multiple websites at the same time, speeding up the execution of your tests.

To run multiple scripts in parallel, execute the following:

```bash
javac ParallelBrowser.java
java ParallelBrowser
```

This will trigger the execution of tests across multiple browsers or platforms simultaneously.
